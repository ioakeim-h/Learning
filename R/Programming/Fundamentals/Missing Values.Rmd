<center><h1> Missing Values </center></h1>

Missing values are denoted by **NA** or **NaN** for undefined mathematical operations.

* `is.na()` is used to test for NAs in objects
* `is.NaN` is used to test for NaN
* NA values have a class also, so there are integer NA, character NA, etc
* A NaN value is also NA but the converse is not true

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 10, 3)
is.na(x)
is.nan(x)
```
