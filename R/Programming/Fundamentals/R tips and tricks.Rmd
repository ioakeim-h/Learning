# Save time when typing errors!

In many programming environments, the up arrow will cycle through previous commands.

# Can't remember variable names

Let's pretend you'd like to view the contents of a variable that you created earlier, but you can't seem to remember if you named it my_div or myDiv. You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the Tab key (possibly more than once).

# View all objects in your workspace, working directory

* workspace - `ls()`
* working directory - `list.files()` or `dir()`

# What arguments can a function take?

`args()` - function goes inside parenthesis as in args(list.files)

# Working in directories
## Create a directory in the current working directory
`dir.create()` - name of new directory goes inside parenthesis as ine dir.create("testdir")

## Create a file in your working directory
`file.create()` - as in file.create("mytest.R")

## Check if a certain file exists in your current working directory
`file.exists()` as in file.exists("mytest.R")

## Access information about a file in your directory

`file.info()` - as in file.info("mytest.R")
You can use the `$` operator --- e.g., `file.info("mytest.R")$mode` --- to grab specific items.
