<center><h1> Logic </center></h1>

## Logical operators

* `<` , `>`
* `<=` , `=>`
* `==` for exact equality
* `!=` for inequality

## Logical statements

If we have two logical expressions, A and B, we can ask whether at least one is TRUE with A | B (logical 'or'
a.k.a. 'union') or whether they are both TRUE with A & B (logical 'and' a.k.a. 'intersection'). Lastly, !A is
the negation of A and is TRUE when A is FALSE and vice versa.

Break this problem down into 2 pieces. The `|` in the middle states that AT LEAST ONE of the pieces is TRUE.
```{r}
(TRUE == TRUE) | (TRUE == FALSE)
```
