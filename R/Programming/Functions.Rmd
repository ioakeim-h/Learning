```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

<center><h1> Create a function </center></h1>

Put your functions in a separate file, an Rscript (not directly in the command line). In the future, you will want to put functions in an R package.

The following function takes two numbers and adds them together.

```{r}
add <- function(x,y) {
x+y
}

add(3, 5)
```
The function adds two values so it has to take two arguments (x and y). Calling add and passing it the arguments 3 and 5 returns 8, meaning that the function works.
