    "\n",
    "If the dataset is too large to handle with Pandas, but the operation you want to perform is not optimal in Spark, you could consider Dask. Dask is a more light-weight parallel computing library that provides a distributed version of Pandas and NumPy. It allows you to perform Pandas-like operations on larger-than-memory datasets and can be used to handle data that does not fit in memory."
